# Open Extension

Open Extension is an specification and implementations to extend applications easily.

Think about any ERP, CRM, e-Commerce, blog, dashboard, panel or any other application you already used and had extensions or plugins so you could install it and extend the application capabilities to perform more or different tasks (ex.: Node RED, Shopify, Wordpress, Chrome, etc).

The following scenarios are ways Open Extension will be able to help you:

- as a platform creator you will be able to easily add an Open Extension Framework so other developers can easily extend your application adding new features or extend the existing ones.
- as a platform creator you will have the ability to easily create a process to select and approve which extensions can run in your application, maintaning aspects of your business and the desired quality
- as a platform creator you will be able to enable your users to easily add more capabilities to their instance/account in your application.
- as a extension builder you will be able to easily design and code an extension that can run across multiple applications.

These are some of the scenarios that the Open Extension will solve in a way that multiple platforms can easily implement and benefit from it.

## Motivation

I've worked in Modules, Plugins, Extensions, Libs and components in the last 20 years. In the last months I've looked for a model to build a NodeJS application that could load and use extensions to easily add features to existing applications.

Different from regular NPM modules, the ideia is that if the same extension-point is implemented in different applications, the contract of the extension-point is respected in both the extension and the host it should work in multiple hosts.

Examples would be payment systems, file systems, notifications management systems, all of this can be extension-points that multiple extensions can implement, and so you could easily choose and migrate the service you use by installing a new extension.

As a service provider you would be able to provide the extension to make easy to others to implement it and foster adoption of a platform.

The goals section bellow details the objectives of the Open Extension Specification.

## Goals

The extensions shall be able to support the following use cases:

- **Time-based extension-points**: defined and execute jobs like cron jobs (use cases: sync, payment verification, email or message sending, resending... )
- **Event-based extension-points**: to features based on logs, monitoring and messaging.
- **Function-based extension-points**: on active calls to be used as extension points in the middle of a process in which the result may be used by the actual application
- **Logs**: enable the host to implement the log with errors, running history and information necessary to re-execute a function if necessary (may the log connectors be extensions itself)
- **Metadata**: to have a standard way to list and document the extension and extension points.
- **Permissions**: enable the host to show and get the acceptance of the permissions required by the extension to run.
- **Privacy**: enable the host to show the privacy information to what data is shared with the extesion.
- **Setup**: a way to install and restore extensions in live applications.

## Components

The framework is currently composed of 3 components.

1. **Open Extension Specification**: The current repo
2. **Open Extension Framework**: Is the Framework that shall be implemented in the host application in order to implement and use the extensions [repo](https://github.com/menvia/open-extension-framework)
3. **Open Extension Kit**: Is a helper module to help developers to develop new extensions [repo](https://github.com/menvia/open-extension-kit)

## Glossary

- **Extension**: An extension is an NPM module that extends the capabilities of a host application.
- **Extension-point**: Is an specific service or task implemented by an extension. An extension can implement multiple extension-points.
- **Host**: The application that uses the extension framework to extend its capabilities.
